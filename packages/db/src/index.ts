/**
 * Prisma Client singleton.
 *
 * Pattern explained:
 *  - In Next.js dev mode (HMR), modules are reloaded on every change. Without
 *    this guard each reload would instantiate a new PrismaClient, leak the
 *    previous connection, and quickly exhaust Neon's pool.
 *  - On Vercel each Lambda invocation may share the singleton across requests
 *    *within the same container*, but cold starts always create a fresh one.
 *    Pair this with a *pooled* DATABASE_URL (Neon's PgBouncer endpoint) and
 *    `connection_limit=1` so each Lambda holds at most one upstream socket.

 * triggers Turbopack's "unexpected export *" runtime helper, which has caused
 * module-init TDZ errors ("Cannot access 'm' before initialization") during
 * Vercel's page-data collection step. Naming the exports avoids that codepath.
 *
 * Runtime values (enums + the `Prisma` namespace + the `PrismaClient` class)
 * need to be re-exported as values. Pure model types are re-exported with
 * `export type` so they're erased at runtime.
